# Project Brief: Primeval Tower

## Overview
Primeval Tower is a mobile game where players fight with "Primes" in arena battles to ascend levels in a tower. The core gameplay loop involves acquiring and upgrading Primes, which are creatures with different rarities, elements, and abilities.

## Core Requirements
- A system for acquiring Primes through hatching Eggs.
- A combat system based on Prime statistics, abilities, and elemental advantages.
- A currency system (Gems) for purchasing in-game items.
- A rune system for customizing and enhancing Primes.
- A user interface with a bottom tab navigation and a persistent header.

## Goals
- Create an engaging and relaxing gameplay experience.
- Implement a fair and enticing monetization model.
- Design a modern, soft, and beautiful user interface with **pastel colors, gradients, and card-based layouts** inspired by wellness/mindfulness apps.

## Design Language
**NEW: Beautiful, Modern Design System**
- **Soft pastel color palette**: Coral, lavender, mint, peach tones
- **Gradient backgrounds**: Smooth linear gradients throughout the app
- **Card-based layouts**: Modern cards with rounded corners and elegant shadows
- **Generous spacing**: Clean, breathable layouts with proper visual hierarchy
- **Friendly typography**: Readable fonts with clear hierarchy
- **Wellness aesthetic**: Calming, nurturing feel rather than aggressive gaming UI

## Project Scope
**In Scope:**
- All features described in the "Primeval Tower - Game Overview_EN.md" document.
- Development of the mobile game for an unspecified platform (assumed to be iOS/Android via React Native/Expo based on project files).

**Out of Scope:**
- Any features not explicitly mentioned in the game overview.
- Backend services beyond what is necessary for the described game mechanics (e.g., user accounts, leaderboards, real-time multiplayer if not implied).
- Specific details on sound design, narrative, or level design for the Tower.
