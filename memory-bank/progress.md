# Progress: Primeval Tower

## What Works
- The project repository has been initialized.
- A comprehensive game overview document exists.
- The Memory Bank is fully set up, providing a solid foundation for development.
- **Asset Organization Complete:** All prime images have been optimized and organized:
  - High-resolution PNG files (2-3MB each) moved to `assets/primes-png/` for development use
  - Optimized WebP files (10-17KB each) stored in `assets/primes/` for runtime use
  - `ImageAssets.ts` updated to reference WebP files for all 80+ prime monsters
  - Added missing primes that were present in folders but not referenced in code

## What's Left to Build
Essentially, the entire game. Key high-level features include:
- User Interface (Navigation, Screens, Components)
- Backend Services (Authentication, Database, Game Logic API)
- Prime System (Acquisition, Data, Abilities)
- Egg & Hatching System (Purchase, Probabilities, Enhancers)
- Combat System (Stats, Turn Order, Damage Calculation, Status Effects)
- Rune System (Equipping, Stats, Synergies)
- Gem/Currency and Shop System
- Player Progression System (Level, XP, Milestones)

## Known Issues and Limitations
- **Limited Code:** Basic React Native project structure exists, but no functional game logic yet.
- **Backend Undefined:** A specific backend technology has not been chosen or implemented.
- **Partial Assets:** Prime monster images are complete and optimized, but other game assets (UI elements, sounds, etc.) are not yet available.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- **Initial Decision:** To start the project with a strong, documented foundation.
- **Reasoning:** The complexity of the game design requires a clear, shared understanding of the goals and architecture from the very beginning.
- **Evolution:** This decision led to the immediate creation of the `Game Overview` document and the full `Memory Bank` before writing any application code. This sets a precedent for a documentation-driven development process. As the project progresses, decisions made in `activeContext.md` will be archived here to provide a historical record.
