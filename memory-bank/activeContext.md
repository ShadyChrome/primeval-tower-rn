# Active Context: Primeval Tower

## Current Work Focus
The current focus has shifted to implementing the core UI structure and game mechanics. We have successfully created the main navigation interface with all required screens and a persistent header showing player information.

## Recent Changes
- **Implemented Complete Main UI:** Created the bottom tab navigator with all 5 required screens (Hatching, Primes, Home, Bag, Shop)
- **Created Persistent Header:** Implemented header component showing player name, level, XP progress bar, and gem count
- **Designed Game Screens:** 
  - Home screen with tower progression and stats overview
  - Hatching screen with egg selection and enhancer system
  - Primes screen with collection management and filtering
  - Bag screen with runes and items inventory
  - Shop screen with gem packages, eggs, enhancers and special offers
- **Added React Navigation:** Installed and configured @react-navigation/native and @react-navigation/bottom-tabs
- **Enhanced Styling:** Implemented warm, pastel color theme as specified in game design
- **Integrated with Authentication:** Connected main UI to existing guest login system

## Next Steps
1.  **Define Data Models:** Create comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all game entities (Prime, Egg, Rune, Ability, etc.)
2.  **Implement State Management:** Set up Zustand stores for game data, player progress, and UI state
3.  **Backend Integration:** Connect screens to Supabase for data persistence
4.  **Add Functionality:** Implement actual hatching, inventory management, and shop purchase logic
5.  **Combat System:** Begin prototyping the turn-based combat system for tower battles

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **UI Component Library:** Deciding whether to build all UI components from scratch or use a library to speed up development. The key is to ensure the chosen approach can deliver the desired "warm, pastel, flat" aesthetic.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- **Documentation-First:** The creation of the Memory Bank at the project's inception establishes a preference for maintaining thorough documentation throughout the development lifecycle.
- **Clear Separation of Concerns:** The initial architecture proposal separates the client, backend, UI, and game logic, indicating a preference for clean, maintainable code.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- The game design is well-defined but complex, with many interconnected systems (Primes, Elements, Hatching, Combat, Runes). A methodical, feature-by-feature approach will be necessary.
- The project's success heavily relies on getting the "feel" right, both in terms of the relaxing UI and the engaging combat loop. Early prototyping and user feedback will be valuable.
