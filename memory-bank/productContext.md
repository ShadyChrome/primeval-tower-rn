# Product Context: Primeval Tower

## Problem Statement
There is a market for mobile games that offer deep, strategic gameplay (creature collection, stat management, tactical combat) but with a relaxing and accessible presentation. Primeval Tower aims to fill this niche by combining proven mechanics from games like Pok√©mon, Summoners War, and Temtem with a warm, pastel-themed UI and a player-friendly monetization strategy. The goal is to create a game that is engaging for hardcore players without being intimidating to casual players.

## User Experience Goals
- **Relaxing Atmosphere:** The UI should be "warm, relaxing, chilling" with a "pastel colored theme" and a "modern, flat" design. This promotes a low-stress environment.
- **Clear Progression:** The player should always understand how to get stronger. This is achieved through ascending the Tower, hatching new Primes, leveling up abilities, and equipping Runes.
- **Fair Monetization:** The shop should feel unified and non-intrusive. The inclusion of low-cost offers and rewards for free-to-play users (watching ads) aims to build goodwill and encourage initial spending without being predatory.
- **Intuitive Navigation:** A standard bottom tab navigator (`Hatching`, `Primes`, `Home`, `Bag`, `Shop`) and a persistent header provide a familiar and easy-to-use interface.

## Success Metrics
- **Player Engagement:** High daily active users (DAU) and long session times.
- **Player Retention:** High rates of players returning day-over-day and week-over-week.
- **Monetization Conversion:** A healthy percentage of players making at least one purchase, particularly converting on the low-cost initial offers.
- **Progression Pace:** Players are consistently clearing Tower stages and upgrading their Primes, indicating a well-balanced difficulty curve.
