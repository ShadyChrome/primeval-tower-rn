# Primeval Tower Development Progress

## Current Status: Phase 3 Complete âœ… + Full Supabase Backend Integration âœ…

### Completed Phases

#### Phase 1: Core Game Structure âœ… 
- Expo/React Native project setup
- Navigation system
- Design system with pastel colors
- Basic screens and components

#### Phase 2: Core Screens Implementation âœ…
- Starter screen with Prime selection
- Collection screen with filtering/sorting  
- Battle simulator screen
- Stats display and ability system
- Element system integration

#### Phase 3: Rune System Implementation âœ…
**COMPLETED**: Advanced rune equipment system with full backend:

**Core Components:**
- `RuneEquipment.tsx` - Main flower layout with 6 slots + center stats
- `RuneSlot.tsx` - Individual hexagonal rune slots with visual feedback
- `RuneSelectionModal.tsx` - Comprehensive rune selection with filtering
- `RuneFilter.tsx` - Reusable filtering component for stats and tiers

**Data Management:**
- Database rune inventory - 17+ diverse runes from Supabase
- `runeFilters.ts` - Stat-based filtering logic (Attack, Defense, Speed, etc.)
- `primeRuneStorage.ts` - Supabase backend with in-memory caching
- `primeRuneService.ts` - **DEPLOYED**: Complete Supabase service layer

**Database Schema - DEPLOYED:**
- âœ… `player_primes` table with full progression tracking
- âœ… `player_runes` table updated with `prime_id` association
- âœ… Database functions for equip/unequip operations
- âœ… RLS policies for data security
- âœ… Automatic triggers for timestamp updates

**Key Features Implemented:**
âœ… **Flower Layout**: 6 rune slots arranged around central stats display
âœ… **Center Stats Display**: Real-time calculation of total bonuses from equipped runes
âœ… **Prime-Specific Storage**: Each Prime saves/loads their own rune equipment
âœ… **Cross-Prime Awareness**: Runes equipped on one Prime are unavailable to others
âœ… **Stat-Based Filtering**: Filter by Attack, Defense, Speed, Courage, Precision, Stamina
âœ… **Synergy System**: 2-set and 4-set bonuses with visual indicators
âœ… **Immediate Persistence**: Auto-save when equipping/unequipping runes
âœ… **Navigation Persistence**: Runes saved/loaded when switching between Primes
âœ… **Reactive UI**: Real-time updates across all components
âœ… **Backend Integration**: Complete Supabase schema deployed and ready

**Integration:**
- Enhanced `PrimeDetailsScreen.tsx` with rune tab and async persistence
- Updated `StatsSection.tsx` to show rune bonuses in stat bars
- Enhanced `BagScreen.tsx` with unified filtering system
- Fixed modal height issues for proper FlatList rendering

**Technical Achievements:**
- Resolved React hooks order errors
- Fixed modal layout and rendering issues
- Implemented AsyncStorage persistence with automatic sync
- **Deployed complete Supabase backend with all migrations**
- Created reusable filtering components for consistency
- Optimized mobile portrait orientation layout

### Phase 4: Planned Features
- Enhanced battle system with rune effects
- Achievement/progression system
- Advanced Prime management
- Performance optimizations

### Current Focus
Phase 3 is now **COMPLETE** with full rune system functionality AND complete backend deployment. The system successfully provides:

**Frontend Features:**
- Individual Prime rune equipment persistence with AsyncStorage
- Cross-Prime rune availability management  
- Real-time stat calculation and display
- User-friendly filtering and selection
- Beautiful visual design optimized for mobile

**Backend Infrastructure:**
- Complete Supabase database schema deployed
- All database functions operational
- Service layer ready for integration
- RLS policies ensuring data security

### Backend Implementation Status - ðŸŽ‰ FULLY COMPLETED
âœ… **Database Schema Deployed**: Complete `player_primes`, `player_runes` tables with UUID relationships
âœ… **Database Functions Active**: All equip/unequip/query functions deployed and tested
âœ… **Service Layer Complete**: `PrimeRuneService`, `RuneService`, `PrimeService` classes operational
âœ… **Frontend Integration**: Complete migration from AsyncStorage to Supabase backend
âœ… **Authentication Integrated**: Device-based auth with PlayerManager working seamlessly
âœ… **Data Populated**: 11 Primes and 17 runes added to player "Shady" for testing
âœ… **RLS Policies Updated**: Security policies adapted for device-based authentication
âœ… **Real-time Synchronization**: Database as source of truth with in-memory caching
âœ… **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks and comprehensive error management

**ðŸš€ PRODUCTION READY**: Complete Supabase backend integration achieved:
1. âœ… Database schema - Deployed with proper relationships
2. âœ… Service functions - All CRUD operations working  
3. âœ… TypeScript types - Full type safety with database schema
4. âœ… Frontend integration - All components using database services
5. âœ… Authentication - Device-based authentication fully integrated
6. âœ… Data persistence - Real-time equipment tracking across Primes
7. âœ… Performance optimization - Caching strategy for responsive UI

**Phase 3 COMPLETE with Full Backend Integration - Zero mock data dependencies! ðŸŽ‰**
