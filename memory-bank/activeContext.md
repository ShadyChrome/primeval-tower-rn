- **‚ú® REDESIGNED TREASURE BOX COMPONENT:** 
  - Simplified from complex card-based UI to clean icon + time layout
  - Maintained all core functionality (claiming, animations, timer calculations)
  - Removed 200+ lines of complex UI code (cards, progress bars, buttons)
  - Increased icon size to 80px for better touch target
  - Added gem count badge when loot is available
  - Preserved all animations (glow, shake, scale) for visual feedback
- **üé® PREVIOUSLY IMPLEMENTED BEAUTIFUL DESIGN SYSTEM:** Created comprehensive design system with:
  - Soft pastel color palette (coral, lavender, mint, peach)
  - Linear gradient backgrounds throughout the app
  - Modern card components with elegant shadows and rounded corners
  - Professional typography hierarchy and spacing system
- **üé® TRANSFORMED KEY SCREENS:** 
  - **LoginScreen:** Now features gradient background with beautiful gradient cards
  - **HomeScreen:** Modernized with GradientCard for main actions and ModernCard for content
  - **PlayerNameScreen:** Elegant gradient background with sophisticated input cards
  - **PrimesScreen:** Complete redesign with modern grid layout, collapsible search, and real prime assets
- **üõ†Ô∏è CREATED REUSABLE COMPONENTS:**
  - `GradientCard`: Beautiful gradient cards with multiple color themes
  - `ModernCard`: Clean cards with proper shadows and spacing
  - `PrimeImage`: Optimized prime image component with caching and fallbacks
  - `ProgressCard`: Wellness-inspired progress tracking (ready for implementation)
- **üì¶ INSTALLED DEPENDENCIES:** Added expo-linear-gradient and recyclerlistview for beautiful effects and performance
- **üéØ DESIGN SYSTEM:** Created `/src/theme/designSystem.ts` with complete color palette, typography, spacing, and styling standards

## Next Steps
1. **üîß PRIME DETAILS MODAL:** Implement the prime details modal/screen that opens when cards are clicked
   - Show detailed prime information: stats, abilities, power, runes, etc.
   - Add rune equipment interface
   - Include upgrade/level up functionality
   - Display full-size prime images with animations
2. **üé® COMPLETE DESIGN ROLLOUT:** Apply the new design system to remaining screens:
   - Transform HatchingScreen, BagScreen, ShopScreen with new components
   - Update MainNavigation with new styling
   - Implement ProgressCard in relevant screens for progress tracking
3. **üì± ENHANCE UX:** Add micro-interactions and animations using react-native-reanimated
4. **üõ†Ô∏è GAME FUNCTIONALITY:** Build on the beautiful foundation to add core game mechanics
5. **üéØ STATE MANAGEMENT:** Set up Zustand stores for game data management
6. **üîó BACKEND INTEGRATION:** Connect screens to Supabase for data persistence

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **Asset Management:** Established a robust asset management system that can easily scale to include more primes, animations, and other game assets
- **Performance Strategy:** Using caching, preloading, and optimized components to ensure smooth performance even with large image assets

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- **Documentation-First:** The creation of the Memory Bank at the project's inception establishes a preference for maintaining thorough documentation throughout the development lifecycle.
- **Clear Separation of Concerns:** The initial architecture proposal separates the client, backend, UI, and game logic, indicating a preference for clean, maintainable code.
- **Minimalist Design Preference:** User prefers clean, simple components over complex UI elements (as demonstrated with TreasureBox redesign and PrimesScreen grid layout)
- **Performance-First Approach:** Using RecyclerListView with proper optimization for grid layouts and responsive card calculations
- **Asset Organization:** Preference for well-organized, type-safe asset management with proper fallbacks and error handling

## Learnings and Project Insights
- The game design is well-defined but complex, with many interconnected systems (Primes, Elements, Hatching, Combat, Runes). A methodical, feature-by-feature approach will be necessary.
- The project's success heavily relies on getting the "feel" right, both in terms of the relaxing UI and the engaging combat loop. Early prototyping and user feedback will be valuable.
- Users prefer clean, functional designs over feature-heavy interfaces - simplicity is key.
- Grid layouts with proper responsive calculations provide much better UX than single-column lists for collection screens.
- Consistent design system application across all screens creates a cohesive, professional appearance.
- Real assets make a dramatic difference in the app's visual appeal and user engagement - the prime cards now look like a professional game.
- Proper asset management from the beginning saves significant refactoring time later in development.
