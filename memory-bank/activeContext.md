## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **Asset Management:** Established a robust asset management system that can easily scale to include more primes, animations, and other game assets
- **Performance Strategy:** Using caching, preloading, and optimized components to ensure smooth performance even with large image assets

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- **Documentation-First:** The creation of the Memory Bank at the project's inception establishes a preference for maintaining thorough documentation throughout the development lifecycle.
- **Clear Separation of Concerns:** The initial architecture proposal separates the client, backend, UI, and game logic, indicating a preference for clean, maintainable code.
- **Minimalist Design Preference:** User prefers clean, simple components over complex UI elements (as demonstrated with TreasureBox redesign and PrimesScreen grid layout)
- **Performance-First Approach:** Using RecyclerListView with proper optimization for grid layouts and responsive card calculations
- **Asset Organization:** Preference for well-organized, type-safe asset management with proper fallbacks and error handling

## Learnings and Project Insights
- The game design is well-defined but complex, with many interconnected systems (Primes, Elements, Hatching, Combat, Runes). A methodical, feature-by-feature approach will be necessary.
- The project's success heavily relies on getting the "feel" right, both in terms of the relaxing UI and the engaging combat loop. Early prototyping and user feedback will be valuable.
- Users prefer clean, functional designs over feature-heavy interfaces - simplicity is key.
- Grid layouts with proper responsive calculations provide much better UX than single-column lists for collection screens.
- Consistent design system application across all screens creates a cohesive, professional appearance.
- Real assets make a dramatic difference in the app's visual appeal and user engagement - the prime cards now look like a professional game.
- Proper asset management from the beginning saves significant refactoring time later in development.
