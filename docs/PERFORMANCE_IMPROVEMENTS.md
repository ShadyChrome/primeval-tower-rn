## TreasureBox Timer Optimization (2025-01-09)

### Problem Identified
The `TreasureBox` component had a **significant performance and battery drain issue** where a timer was running continuously every second, even when the Home screen was not active.

### Issue Details
- **Timer Frequency**: Executed every second (86,400 times per day)
- **Continuous Operation**: Ran regardless of screen focus state
- **Resource Impact**: 
  - High CPU usage from constant calculations
  - Battery drain from preventing JavaScript idle state
  - Memory consumption from extensive logging
  - Potential UI performance degradation

### Performance Implications
- **🔥 CPU Usage**: Constant date calculations and state updates
- **🔋 Battery Drain**: JavaScript thread never enters idle state
- **📱 Memory Impact**: Logging filled memory buffers, frequent garbage collection
- **🐌 UI Performance**: Background calculations interfering with animations

### Solution Implemented
Replaced the always-running timer with **navigation-aware timer management** using React Navigation's `useFocusEffect` hook.

#### Key Changes
1. **Added Focus-Based Timer Control**:
   ```typescript
   import { useFocusEffect } from '@react-navigation/native'
   
   useFocusEffect(
     React.useCallback(() => {
       // Start timer only when screen is focused
       if (statusRef.current) {
         updateClientSideTimer()
         timerRef.current = setInterval(updateClientSideTimer, 1000)
       }
       
       return () => {
         // Cleanup timer when screen loses focus
         if (timerRef.current) {
           clearInterval(timerRef.current)
           timerRef.current = null
         }
       }
     }, [status])
   )
   ```

2. **Proper Timer Reference Management**:
   - Added `timerRef` for proper cleanup
   - Removed global `useEffect` timer setup
   - Ensured timer only runs when needed

### Benefits
- **✅ Reduced CPU Usage**: Timer only runs when Home screen is active
- **✅ Better Battery Life**: JavaScript thread can enter idle state
- **✅ Lower Memory Usage**: Reduced logging and state updates
- **✅ Improved UI Performance**: No background interference
- **✅ Maintained Functionality**: Timer still updates accurately when visible

### Technical Implementation
- **Hook Used**: `useFocusEffect` from `@react-navigation/native`
- **Timer Management**: `setInterval`/`clearInterval` with proper cleanup
- **State Management**: Preserved existing state logic
- **Backward Compatibility**: No breaking changes to component API

### Testing Recommendations
- Monitor logs to confirm timer stops when switching tabs
- Verify loot calculations remain accurate
- Test battery usage over extended periods
- Confirm animations still work properly

This optimization significantly improves app performance while maintaining all existing functionality.

## PrimesScreen Filter Crash Fix (2025-01-09)

### Problem Identified
The `PrimesScreen` had a **critical crash issue** when applying both rarity and element filters that resulted in empty data sets.

### Issue Details
- **Error**: `TypeError: Cannot read property 'y' of undefined` in `RNCSafeAreaProvider`
- **Trigger**: Applying filter combinations that result in zero matching Primes
- **Root Cause**: `RecyclerListView` trying to render with empty data array
- **Impact**: App crash when users applied strict filter combinations

### Performance & UX Implications
- **💥 App Crashes**: Users unable to use filter functionality
- **🚫 Poor UX**: No feedback when filters yield no results
- **⚠️ Data Loss**: Potential loss of filter state on crash
- **📱 Reliability**: App instability affecting user trust

### Solution Implemented
Added **conditional rendering with empty state handling** to prevent RecyclerListView crashes.

#### Key Changes
1. **Conditional RecyclerListView Rendering**:
   ```typescript
   {rowData.length > 0 ? (
     <RecyclerListView
       dataProvider={dataProvider}
       layoutProvider={layoutProvider}
       rowRenderer={renderRow}
       // ... other props
     />
   ) : (
     <EmptyStateComponent />
   )}
   ```

2. **Comprehensive Empty State UI**:
   - Clear messaging for different empty scenarios
   - Reset filters button for quick recovery
   - Contextual help text based on active filters
   - Proper styling and accessibility

3. **Enhanced User Experience**:
   - Graceful degradation when no results found
   - One-click filter reset functionality
   - Clear visual feedback about current filter state

### Benefits
- **✅ Crash Prevention**: No more app crashes from empty filter results
- **✅ Better UX**: Clear feedback when no Primes match filters
- **✅ Quick Recovery**: Easy reset button to clear filters
- **✅ Improved Reliability**: Stable app performance with all filter combinations
- **✅ Enhanced Accessibility**: Better screen reader support for empty states

### Technical Implementation
- **Error Handling**: Conditional rendering prevents RecyclerListView crashes
- **Empty State Component**: Custom UI for no-results scenarios
- **Filter Reset**: Quick action to clear all active filters
- **Responsive Design**: Proper layout for all screen sizes

### Testing Recommendations
- Test all possible filter combinations
- Verify empty state displays correctly
- Confirm reset button works properly
- Test with screen readers for accessibility

This fix eliminates crashes and significantly improves the user experience when filtering Primes.
