## Database Integration

### Required Supabase Functions
```sql
-- Get detailed prime data with stats and equipment
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_prime_details(p_prime_id TEXT)
RETURNS JSON AS $$
-- Implementation details for fetching complete prime data
$$;

-- Equip rune to prime slot
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION equip_rune_to_prime(
  p_player_id TEXT,
  p_prime_id TEXT,
  p_rune_id TEXT,
  p_slot_index INTEGER
) RETURNS BOOLEAN AS $$
-- Implementation for rune equipping
$$;

-- Upgrade prime level using XP items
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION upgrade_prime_level(
  p_player_id TEXT,
  p_prime_id TEXT,
  p_xp_item_id TEXT,
  p_quantity INTEGER
) RETURNS JSON AS $$
-- Implementation for prime leveling
$$;
```

### New Database Tables (if needed)
```sql
-- Prime instances with individual progression
CREATE TABLE player_primes (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  player_id TEXT REFERENCES players(id),
  prime_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  element TEXT NOT NULL,
  rarity TEXT NOT NULL,
  level INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
  experience INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  abilities JSONB DEFAULT '[]',
  acquired_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  total_battles INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  total_wins INTEGER DEFAULT 0
);

-- Rune synergy definitions
CREATE TABLE rune_synergies (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  required_runes INTEGER NOT NULL,
  stat_bonuses JSONB NOT NULL
);
```

## Testing Strategy

- [ ] Performance under various conditions

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies
- **Lazy loading** of prime data when modal opens
- **Memoized calculations** for stats and synergies
- **Virtualized rune lists** for large inventories
- **Image caching** for prime and rune assets
- **Debounced updates** for real-time stat previews

### Memory Management
- **Component cleanup** when modal closes
- **Subscription management** for database listeners
- **Image disposal** for large prime assets
- **State cleanup** for complex calculations

## Success Metrics

### User Engagement
- **Modal open rate**: % of prime taps that result in modal views
- **Time spent in modal**: Average session duration
- **Rune equipment rate**: % of users who equip runes
- **Upgrade completion rate**: % of upgrade attempts that complete

### Technical Performance
- **Modal open time**: < 300ms from tap to display
- **Smooth animations**: 60 FPS throughout interaction
- **Database response time**: < 200ms for all queries
- **Memory usage**: < 50MB additional when modal is open

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Prime comparison mode**: Side-by-side prime comparison
- **Loadout presets**: Save/load rune configurations
- **Battle simulation**: Preview combat effectiveness
- **Prime sharing**: Social features and screenshots
- **Advanced filtering**: Filter primes by various criteria

### Technical Improvements
- **Offline mode**: Cache prime data for offline viewing
- **Background sync**: Update prime data in background
- **Advanced animations**: More sophisticated visual effects
- **AR integration**: View primes in augmented reality

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Performance**: Complex calculations may impact performance
- **Data consistency**: Concurrent rune equipment conflicts
- **Memory usage**: Large number of prime assets
- **Animation complexity**: Smooth animations on older devices

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Performance profiling** throughout development
- **Database transaction management** for consistency
- **Asset optimization** and lazy loading
- **Progressive enhancement** for animations

## Conclusion

The Prime Details Modal represents a crucial feature that transforms the game from a collection interface into an interactive management system. By implementing this feature with attention to user experience, performance, and extensibility, we create a foundation for future game mechanics while providing immediate value to players.

The phased approach ensures steady progress with testable milestones, while the comprehensive technical plan addresses potential challenges proactively. This feature will significantly enhance player engagement and set the stage for combat system implementation.
