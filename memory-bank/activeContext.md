# Active Context: Primeval Tower

## Current Work Focus
**üéØ PRIMES SCREEN REDESIGN COMPLETE!** Just finished implementing a comprehensive redesign of the PrimesScreen with modern styling, compact search section, and 4-column grid layout following the established design system.

## Recent Changes
- **üé® PRIMES SCREEN REDESIGN:** 
  - **Compact Search Section:** Replaced bulky SegmentedButtons with elegant chip-based filters

  - Updated `LootModal` to use the new centered modal system
  - All modals now open perfectly centered on the device screen with consistent styling
  - Added proper Portal-based modal overlay with customizable background opacity
- **‚ú® REDESIGNED TREASURE BOX COMPONENT:** 
  - Simplified from complex card-based UI to clean icon + time layout
  - Maintained all core functionality (claiming, animations, timer calculations)
  - Removed 200+ lines of complex UI code (cards, progress bars, buttons)
  - Increased icon size to 80px for better touch target
  - Added gem count badge when loot is available
  - Preserved all animations (glow, shake, scale) for visual feedback
- **üé® PREVIOUSLY IMPLEMENTED BEAUTIFUL DESIGN SYSTEM:** Created comprehensive design system with:
  - Soft pastel color palette (coral, lavender, mint, peach)
  - Linear gradient backgrounds throughout the app
  - Modern card components with elegant shadows and rounded corners
  - Professional typography hierarchy and spacing system
- **üé® TRANSFORMED KEY SCREENS:** 
  - **LoginScreen:** Now features gradient background with beautiful gradient cards
  - **HomeScreen:** Modernized with GradientCard for main actions and ModernCard for content
  - **PlayerNameScreen:** Elegant gradient background with sophisticated input cards
  - **PrimesScreen:** Complete redesign with modern grid layout and compact search
- **üõ†Ô∏è CREATED REUSABLE COMPONENTS:**
  - `GradientCard`: Beautiful gradient cards with multiple color themes
  - `ModernCard`: Clean cards with proper shadows and spacing
  - `ProgressCard`: Wellness-inspired progress tracking (ready for implementation)
- **üì¶ INSTALLED DEPENDENCIES:** Added expo-linear-gradient for beautiful gradient effects
- **üéØ DESIGN SYSTEM:** Created `/src/theme/designSystem.ts` with complete color palette, typography, spacing, and styling standards

## Next Steps
1. **üîß PRIME DETAILS MODAL:** Implement the prime details modal/screen that opens when cards are clicked
   - Show detailed prime information: stats, abilities, power, runes, etc.
   - Add rune equipment interface
   - Include upgrade/level up functionality
2. **üé® COMPLETE DESIGN ROLLOUT:** Apply the new design system to remaining screens:
   - Transform HatchingScreen, BagScreen, ShopScreen with new components
   - Update MainNavigation with new styling
   - Implement ProgressCard in relevant screens for progress tracking
3. **üì± ENHANCE UX:** Add micro-interactions and animations using react-native-reanimated
4. **üõ†Ô∏è GAME FUNCTIONALITY:** Build on the beautiful foundation to add core game mechanics
5. **üéØ STATE MANAGEMENT:** Set up Zustand stores for game data management
6. **üîó BACKEND INTEGRATION:** Connect screens to Supabase for data persistence

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **UI Component Library:** Deciding whether to build all UI components from scratch or use a library to speed up development. The key is to ensure the chosen approach can deliver the desired "warm, pastel, flat" aesthetic.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- **Documentation-First:** The creation of the Memory Bank at the project's inception establishes a preference for maintaining thorough documentation throughout the development lifecycle.
- **Clear Separation of Concerns:** The initial architecture proposal separates the client, backend, UI, and game logic, indicating a preference for clean, maintainable code.
- **Minimalist Design Preference:** User prefers clean, simple components over complex UI elements (as demonstrated with TreasureBox redesign and PrimesScreen grid layout)
- **Performance-First Approach:** Using FlatList with proper optimization for grid layouts and responsive card calculations

## Learnings and Project Insights
- The game design is well-defined but complex, with many interconnected systems (Primes, Elements, Hatching, Combat, Runes). A methodical, feature-by-feature approach will be necessary.
- The project's success heavily relies on getting the "feel" right, both in terms of the relaxing UI and the engaging combat loop. Early prototyping and user feedback will be valuable.
- Users prefer clean, functional designs over feature-heavy interfaces - simplicity is key.
- Grid layouts with proper responsive calculations provide much better UX than single-column lists for collection screens.
- Consistent design system application across all screens creates a cohesive, professional appearance.
