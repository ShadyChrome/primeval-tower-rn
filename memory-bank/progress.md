- [x] **Error Handling**: Comprehensive user feedback for all scenarios
- [x] **Database Integration**: Live backend with proper error handling

## âœ… Phase 4.5: Auth Simplification & Production Cleanup - COMPLETED
- [x] **Unified Auth Flow**: All users use anonymous auth + device mapping
- [x] **Legacy System Removal**: Eliminated dual-path complexity
- [x] **Production Cleanup**: Removed all test utilities and debug functions
- [x] **Enhanced Security**: Single RLS-enabled auth system
- [x] **Persistence Fix**: Improved session restoration for app restarts
- [x] **Production Ready**: Clean codebase with professional starter quantities

### **Core Benefits Achieved:**
- **Simplified Maintenance**: Single auth path reduces complexity
- **Enhanced Security**: All operations use proper RLS context
- **Session Persistence**: Anonymous users persist across app restarts
- **Production Ready**: Clean codebase without test-related bloat
- **Better Performance**: Reduced complexity and improved auth flow

### **Authentication Flow (Production):**
```
App Launch â†’ Session Refresh â†’ Check Session â†’ 
If Session: Load Player Data â†’ Login
If No Session: Create Anonymous â†’ Device Mapping â†’ Player Creation
```

### **Persistence Logic:**
- **Anonymous Sessions**: Automatically persist via Supabase AsyncStorage
- **Device Mapping**: Links device to persistent game user ID in database
- **Session Restoration**: Force refresh on app startup ensures reliability
- **Cross-Session Data**: Player data survives app restarts and reinstalls
